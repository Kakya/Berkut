<h2>Eagles Everywhere</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>Polish Goal:</strong>
Game feel. Removed enemies, wanted to distill the game to the basic flight mechanics.
The player was converted to a P2 Physics engine. 
The goal is to get a nicer feel of flying the plane, with inertia and some basic characteristics of planes.

</li>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
2-D side-scrolling, flight game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To have fun maneuvering a plane in 2-D space.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The game is a 2-D sidescroller.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The player in this prototype can manipulate the plane to "Fly" in 2-D space by adjusting the "pitch" using angular acceleration and then applying thrust by adding horizontal velocity. Missiles have been added! So have enemies, now the player can fight and avoid enemy planes.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To get fighting actions working in the game space.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game has certain angular movements to allow for more plane-esque behavior while still remaining at its core a sidescroller. Furthermore, the player may fire missiles (AIM-9 Sidewinders) at the enemy planes to prevent them from advancing. The goal is to achieve a high score before dying.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in an alternate history timeline in 2002, where the USSR and the US have been at war since 1989 over the status of a re-unified Germany. The player is given one of a new series of fighter jets (F-22s) that the US hopes to stem the tide of Soviet bombers entering NATO airspace. This fighter is, however, countered by Soviet S-37 Berkuts and the player must achieve air superiority by defeating the new Berkuts.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The tension will entirely come from the gameplay tension, there isn't much of a story except for the backstory
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All those who like fighter jets (Everyone that has ever existed. Ever. Including Augustus Caesar.) and side-scrolling games (See previous paranthetical).
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
In its more than half-completed state, the game can go on until the player gets killed by an enemy fighter.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
An effective strategy would be to remain at high-altitudes and dive upon enemy fighters as they appear.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not fork a specific Phaser game, but I made extensive use of the example physics modules for angular acceleration and velocity (to make the planes "pitch"). Similarly for music, used some of the modules to  help install music into the game.
